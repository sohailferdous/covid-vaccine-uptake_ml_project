# A machine learning approach to map and predict inequalities in COVID-19 vaccine uptake in Scotland
<p>This is a mini-project which serves as a proof-of-concept for the PhD project “Developing Novel Data-Driven Tools and Methodologies to Understand Inequalities in Maternity Vaccination Uptake in Scotland”, which aims to investigate variations in maternal RSV vaccine uptake in Scotland.</p> 
<p>The objectives of this report include exploring existing patterns of COVID-19 vaccine uptake in Scotland according to socioeconomic status and ethnicity as of June 18, 2023; and to train a random forest machine learning algorithm which would predict areas of low vaccine uptake based on population size, health board, and socioeconomic status/ethnicity. Through these objectives, this report attempts to justify the role of artificial intelligence tools when studying inequalities of RSV maternal vaccine uptake, and to demonstrate the author’s data analysis, programming, and scientific communication skills.</p>
<p>This repository holds the script for data analysis and the final report. COVID-19 vaccine data for this project was obtained from Public Health Scotland's Scottish Health and Social Care Open Data repository and is available under the UK Open Government Licence (OGL). The data is available at: https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/flu-covid-vaccinations.</p>
